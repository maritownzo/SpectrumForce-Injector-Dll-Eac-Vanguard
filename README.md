This project is a tool developed in c++ that runs on the Windows operating system and allows to inject dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the memory of another application. DLL injection can be used to modify or extend functionality at runtime of an application. This project provides the user with an interface to automate the DLL injection process.

## Features

- **DLL Injection**: The ability to inject a specific DLL file into another application's memory.
- **Automatic Injection**: Automatically perform DLL injection when a specific application starts or when a specific event occurs.
- **Advanced Settings**: Ability to configure various parameters for the injection process.

## Usage

1. Clone the project to your computer or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Open the solution file (.sln).
3. Select **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu or press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to compile the project.
3. Run the `injector.exe` file.
4. Select the DLL file to inject and the target application.
5. Start the process and check that the injection has taken place.

## Warning

Be careful when using this program. DLL injection may, in some cases, cause other applications to malfunction or cause undesirable results. Use of this program is entirely at your own risk.
